This study is conducted by student researchers in Computational Social Science at the University of Amsterdam (UvA) and in partnership with the Municipality of Amsterdam. 

 

Goal of the study 

The aim of the study is to develop an interactive website focusing on water ecology management across global cities, providing accessible knowledge to a broad audience. The information gathered in this survey is needed to assess the level of awareness of the general public regarding water quality management within their city and globally. 

 

Procedure of the study 

If you agree to participate, you will be asked to take part in a survey. You will be asked several multiple-choice questions or statements. For each question or statement, you can indicate the extent to which you agree or disagree with something, or indicate which answer you think applies the most. There is also one open-ended question. We ask questions about your knowledge of water quality issues and your interest and preferences for a digital intervention regarding water management worldwide. 

 

Voluntary Participation 

Your participation in this study is voluntary: you are not obliged to participate. You may decide to stop your participation at any time during the study. 

 

Privacy 

Your responses will be kept confidential. All data will be securely stored and only accessible to the research team and directly relevant UvA instructors. No identifying information will be gathered through this survey; all data is anonymous. 

 

We use some third-party software to store and process your data. UvA has contracts with these parties to guarantee your privacy: 


	Your data will be securely stored with Microsoft OneDrive and/or Canvas.
	Your data will be processed by Qualtrics to store data, analyze data, collaborate, manage questionnaires, etc.

The following questions are about your behavior and interest in water management and conservation.


On a scale from 1-10 indicate how interested you are in water quality management within your city. (10 being extremely interested, and 0 being not interested at all.) - Interest",Have you participated in any activity related to water conservation or cleanup?,Would you be interested in learning more about how your city manages its water quality?,Would you be interested in learning more about how to improve water quality within your community?,What topics would you like to learn more about regarding water quality?,"Platform Preferences
The following questions are about your personal preferences for a digital platform exploring water quality management in global cities. If you are not interested in such a platform, you can skip to the end of the survey.


If a digital platform existed to explore water quality projects and urban aquatic ecosystems, how likely would you visit it?
